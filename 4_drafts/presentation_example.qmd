## Import table

```{=tex}

\input{../3_output/table_1.tex}

```

## Summary

-   We find that the type of language used in performance feedback has consequences for how people process and act on that feedback.
-   Consistent with our predictions, assertive language increases advice following when it originates from a superior.
-   However, inconsistent with our predictions, it also does when it originates from a subordinate.
-   We also find that the increase in advice following due to assertive language is driven by low performers

## Thank you!
